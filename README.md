# Speech-Endpoint-Detection

An implementation of my work on speech endpoint detection. The implementation can be found in the code titled speechdetection.py

Short term zero crossing rates and energy thresholds are used to detect endpoints in a speech which is in turn potrayed as a waveform.

The above 2 images potray an example of this implementation. The image on the left is the input waveform with noise between speech while that on the right is the output waveform.
